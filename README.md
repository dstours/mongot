# mongot
mongot makes it easy to extract data from open MongoDB's. By specifying an IP/port with the -d/-p parameters, mongot will connect to an open MongoDB, display any identified database names, collections, and a small sample of data in each.

```python
usage: mongot.py [-h] -d D [-p P]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -d D        Destination IP.
  -p P        Destination Port (default: 27017).
  ```


This is still a work in progress.
